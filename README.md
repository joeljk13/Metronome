Metronome
=========

Although this metronome isn't very pretty at the moment, and the user interface
is currently lacking, it has the typical features of metronomes, plus the
following:

* Automatically switch between different sections, which can have different
time signatures and tempos.
* Accelerate and retard at arbitrary rates.
* Tick at arbitrary rhythms.
* And maybe more that I've forgotten.
